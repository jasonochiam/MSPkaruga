# MSPkaruga
A recreation of the game Ikaruga on an MPSM-family microcontroller. Fully equipped with custom sprites, interrupts, drivers, PCB, and sound.
Developed by Jason Ochiam and Aidan Aalund. Assets from Space Invaders, ourselves, and [opengameart](https://opengameart.org/). Thanks to Dr. Jonathan Valvano and everyone who supported us this semester.
